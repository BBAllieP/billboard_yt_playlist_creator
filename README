This is the Create Billboard Charts YouTube Playlist script
It is a Python script that will download some of the current Billboard charts
and create YouTube playlists containing videos for all the songs for the charts.
If it is run regularly, it will create new playlists each week for the new Billboard
charts.

The script depends on the following imports:
Google GData API Python Client (http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)
Universal Feed Parser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)

When run, the script downloads the current charts from RSS feeds on the Billboard website.
For each chart, it searches YouTube for a video of each song and adds the first result
to a dated playlist of the chart for this week.

The charts that the script creates playlists for are:
- Hot 100
- Pop
- Dance/Club Play
- R&B/Hip-Hop
- Rock

An example of what the script creates can be seen here:

Unfortunately there's no way to edit YouTube channels with the GData API, so if you want
the playlists to be in the Featured section of your channel, you have to add them manually.

Using:
Copy settings-example.cfg to settings.cfg and fill in your Google API Developer Key and
YouTube account information.  Then run:

$ python createbillboardplaylist.py
